GE Healthcare is the $19 billion healthcare business of GE (NYSE: GE). As a leading provider of medical imaging, monitoring, biomanufacturing, and cell and gene therapy technologies, GE Healthcare enables precision health in diagnostics, therapeutics and monitoring through intelligent devices, data analytics, applications and services. This is going to be a conflict. With over 100 years of experience in the healthcare industry and more than 50,000 employees globally, the company helps improve outcomes more efficiently for patients, healthcare providers, researchers and life sciences companies around the world.

As leaders in medical imaging, mobile diagnostics & monitoring, digital and life sciences, the company connects innovative technology, data and biology to deliver on the promise of precision health. Small change here.

GE Healthcare is part of the global footprint of GE. We work every day to bring innovative solutions that improve health and create opportunities. We build things that matter to help solve some of the worldâ€™s most complex challenges and provide a foundation for a sustainable future.

Conflicting?

GE Healthcare employs approximately 20,000 people across the United States. The culture of our business and the character of our people compel us to make a difference where we live and work.

Community engagement for GE Healthcare is not only about giving back. It is also about enabling positive changes around the world and in our neighborhoods. Being part of the fabric of local communities is what allows us and everyone to grow.

This won't conflict, but is a change
